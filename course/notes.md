**CUSTOM HOOK**

A custom can be treated as a function simply which is executed from within the functional component and effectively the hooks that are present in the custom hook are transferred on to the component. So any change that would normally cause the component to re-render if the code within the custom hook was directly written within functional component will cause a re-render even if the hook is a custom hook.
